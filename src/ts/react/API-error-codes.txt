Below are the categories of responses by their status codes:

2xx Success

200 OK: Returned by a successful GET or DELETE operation. PUT or POST can also use this, if the service does not want to return a resource back to the client after creation or modification.

201 Created: Response for a successful resource creation by a POST request.

3xx Redirection

304 Not Modified: Used if HTTP caching header is implemented.

4xx Client Errors

400 Bad Request: When an HTTP request body canâ€™t be parsed. For example, if an API is expecting a body in a JSON format for a POST request, but the body of the request is malformed.

401 Unauthorized: Authentication is unsuccessful (or credentials have not been provided) while accessing the API.

403 Forbidden: If a user is not Authorized to perform an action although authentication information is correct.

404 Not Found: If the requested resource is not available on the server.

405 Method Not Allowed: If the user is trying to violate an API contract, for example, trying to update a resource by using a POST method.

5xx Server Errors

These errors occur due to server failures or issues with the underlying infrastructure.
